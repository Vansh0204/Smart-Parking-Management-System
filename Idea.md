# Smart Parking Management System

## Problem Statement
Finding parking in urban areas is inefficient and time-consuming. Drivers waste time searching for available slots, while parking operators lack intelligent allocation, pricing, and monitoring mechanisms.

This project proposes a Smart Parking Management System that enables drivers to view parking availability, reserve slots, and perform entry/exit operations while allowing administrators to manage parking lots, pricing models, and system analytics.

## Project Scope

The system will function as a full-stack application where the backend manages slot allocation, reservations, billing, and pricing logic, while the frontend provides user interaction.

The focus of the project is on backend system design, object modeling, and application of software engineering principles.

## Key Features

### Driver Features
- View parking lot availability
- Reserve parking slots
- Vehicle entry & exit tracking
- Automated billing calculation
- View booking history

### Admin Features
- Create and manage parking lots
- Configure pricing strategies
- Monitor slot occupancy
- View revenue and usage statistics

---

## System Design Goals
- Follow OOP principles (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Maintain clean layered architecture (Controller / Service / Repository)
- Use suitable design patterns where applicable
- Ensure modular, maintainable backend structure

---

## Key Design Patterns Used

- Strategy Pattern → Dynamic pricing calculation
- State Pattern → Parking slot status management
- Factory Pattern → Vehicle creation logic
- Observer Pattern → Slot change notifications

---

## Expected Outcome
A scalable parking management backend capable of handling reservations, slot allocation, billing logic, and configurable pricing rules.
